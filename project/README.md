# Hemispheres Effect on Temperature and Currents

For this project, I am investigating the effects of the Northern and Southern hemispheres on ocean currents and sea surface temperature. The question that will be asked is:

*How would ocean currents and sea surface temperature levels be affected if the Northern and Southern hemispheres were flipped?*

## Project Description
My region of interest is the North Atlantic Gyre. I will construct a model spanning this area and run my simulation two times, one with the flipped hemispheres and one with the normal hemispheres. I anticipate the 	concentration of warm water will be greater on the east side of the North Atlantic Ocean and the direction of the North Atlantic Gyre will reverse.

For initial conditions, I will use the ECCO Version 5 Model from 2016. I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions from the output of this model. The results will be analyzed from a time series of temperature and velocity in the North Atlantic Ocean created from the two models. Two movies will be created for visualization. The first movie will have the initial conditions and the second movie will have the flipped hemispheres.
